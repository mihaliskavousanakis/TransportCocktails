The folder NonSpecificAntibodies_Porosity includes all files required to reproduce the fitting of the porosity profile adopted for the simulation 
of Antibodies in spheroids. 
The porosity profile can be obtained running the file: porosity_optimization.m and should produce 
phi=0.43948*r^3.1974+0.56052

The folder NonAdheringNonReleasingLiposomes_Porosity includes all files required to reproduce the fitting of the porosity profile adopted for the simulation 
of Liposomes in spheroids. 
The porosity profile can be obtained running the file: porosity_optimization.m and should produce 
phi=0.83209*r^5.1257+0.16791

Cocktal_Simulation folder includes all files required to reproduce cocktail carrier simulations
